I am a research scientist at the
[University of Southampton.](https://www.soton.ac.uk) An engineer by training, I now work primarily as an informatician.
My research subject is antigen processing and presentation by major histocompatibility molecules.

My principal project aims to [improve immunotherapy treatment for cancer patients.](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/funding-for-researchers/accelerator-award/portfolio-funded-projects-outputs) Other projects include research into influenza, COVID19, skin sensitization to chemical allergens, asthma and contagious cancer in the Tasmanian Devil. I am also a [Data and Software Carpentry](https://carpentries.org/) instructor.
