 abstract = {<p>The selection of peptides for presentation at the surface of most nucleated
cells by major histocompatibility complex class I molecules (MHC I) is crucial to
the immune response in vertebrates. However, the mechanisms of the rapid
selection of high affinity peptides by MHC I from amongst thousands of mostly low
affinity peptides are not well understood. We developed computational systems
models encoding distinct mechanistic hypotheses for two molecules, HLA-B*44:02
(B*4402) and HLA-B*44:05 (B*4405), which differ by a single residue yet lie at
opposite ends of the spectrum in their intrinsic ability to select high affinity
peptides. We used <em>in vivo</em> biochemical data to infer that a
conformational intermediate of MHC I is significant for peptide selection. We
used molecular dynamics simulations to show that peptide selector function
correlates with protein plasticity, and confirmed this experimentally by altering
the plasticity of MHC I with a single point mutation, which altered <em>in
vivo</em> selector function in a predictable way. Finally, we investigated the
mechanisms by which the co-factor tapasin influences MHC I plasticity. We propose
that tapasin modulates MHC I plasticity by dynamically coupling the peptide
binding region and α<sub>3</sub> domain of MHC I allosterically, resulting in
enhanced peptide selector function.</p>},
