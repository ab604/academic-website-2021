Two challenges in identifying the immunodominant epitopes needed to generate a universal T cell influenza vaccine are: A lack of cell models susceptible to influenza infection which present population-prevalent HLA allotypes, and an absence of a reliable in-vitro method of identifying class II HLA peptides. Here we present a mass spectrometry-based proteomics strategy for identifying viral peptides derived from the A/H3N2/X31 and A/H3N2/Wisconsin/67/2005 strains of influenza. We compared the HLA-I and -II immunopeptidomes presented by ex-vivo influenza challenged human lung tissues. We then compared these with directly infected immortalised macrophage-like cell line (THP1) and primary dendritic cells fed apoptotic influenza-infected respiratory epithelial cells. In each of the three experimental conditions we identified novel influenza class I and II HLA peptides with motifs specific for the host allotype. Ex-vivo infected lung tissues yielded few class-II HLA peptides despite significant numbers of alveolar macrophages, including directly infected ones, present within the tissues. THP1 cells presented HLA-I viral peptides derived predominantly from internal proteins. Primary dendritic cells presented predominantly viral envelope-derived HLA class II peptides following phagocytosis of apoptotic infected cells. The most frequent viral source protein for HLA-I and -II was matrix 1 protein (M1). This work confirms that internal influenza proteins, particularly M1, are a rich source of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell epitopes. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of two ex-vivo fully human infection models which enable direct HLA-I and -II immunopeptide identification without significant viral tropism limitations. Application of this epitope discovery strategy in a clinical setting will provide more certainty in rational vaccine design against influenza and other emergent viruses. Author Summary Influenza infections present a significant global health challenge. High rates of mutation require reformulation of vaccines annually. Vaccines are designed to induce antibody responses to the surface proteins of the influenza virus, but the contribution of T cells to overall immunity is unclear. Here, we used several totally human laboratory models to show how the viral proteins are presented to the T cells to induce immunity. We found that CD8 T cells, which kill infected cells, and CD4 T cells which support the CD8 T cells as well as the antibody-producing B cells, mainly see proteins from inside the viral particle, not the surface ones which are targeted by antibodies. These internal viral proteins are more similar between different viral strains than the surface proteins, and therefore suggest that vaccines designed to induce T cell responses could be better protective if they target internal viral proteins.","tags":null,"title":"Immunopeptidomic analysis of influenza A virus infected human tissues identifies internal proteins as a rich source of HLA ligands","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ben Nicholas","Alistair Bailey","Karl J Staples","Tom Wilkinson","Tim Elliott","Paul Skipp"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1627776000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627776000,"objectID":"1cfeb40ca2aea6c3f514dcce0da69000","permalink":"https://ab604.uk/pubs/old-content/content/publication/nicholas-2021/","publishdate":"2021-08-25T08:04:42.905594Z","relpermalink":"/pubs/old-content/content/publication/nicholas-2021/","section":"pubs","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Immunopeptidomic analysis of influenza A virus infected human tissues identifies internal proteins as a rich source of HLA ligands","type":"pubs"},{"authors":["Alistair Bailey","Ben Nicholas","Rachel Darley","Erika Parkinson","Ying Teo","Maja Aleksic","Gavin Maxwell","Tim Elliott","Michael Ardern-Jones","Paul Skipp"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1614556800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1614556800,"objectID":"0b63cea104c433035329fd25c7ef7380","permalink":"https://ab604.uk/publication/bailey-characterization-2021/","publishdate":"2021-08-25T09:30:55.961922Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bailey-characterization-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"Skin sensitization following the covalent modification of proteins by low molecular weight chemicals (haptenation) is mediated by cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) recognition of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) molecules presented on the surface of almost all nucleated cells. There exist 3 nonmutually exclusive hypotheses for how haptens mediate CTL recognition: direct stimulation by haptenated peptides, hapten modification of HLA leading to an altered HLA-peptide repertoire, or a hapten altered proteome leading to an altered HLA-peptide repertoire. To shed light on the mechanism underpinning skin sensitization, we set out to utilize proteomic analysis of keratinocyte presented antigens following exposure to 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB). We show that the following DNCB exposure, cultured keratinocytes present cysteine haptenated (dinitrophenylated) peptides in multiple HLA molecules. In addition, we find that one of the DNCB modified peptides derives from the active site of cytosolic glutathione-S transferase-ω. These results support the current view that a key mechanism of skin sensitization is stimulation of CTLs by haptenated peptides.

The survival of the Tasmanian devil, the largest remaining marsupial carnivore, is threatened by the remarkable emergence of two independent lineages of transmissible cancer, devil facial tumour (DFT) 1 and devil facial tumour 2 (DFT2). To aid the development of a vaccine and to interrogate how histocompatibility barriers can be overcome, we analysed the peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) molecules from Tasmanian devil cells and representative cell lines of each transmissible cancer. Here, we show that DFT1 + IFN-γ and DFT2 cell lines express a restricted repertoire of MHC-I allotypes compared with fibroblast cells, potentially reducing the breadth of peptide presentation. Comparison of the peptidomes from DFT1 + IFNγ, DFT2 and host fibroblast cells demonstrates a dominant motif, despite differences in MHC-I allotypes between the cell lines, with preference for a hydrophobic leucine residue at position 3 and position Ω of peptides. DFT1 and DFT2 both present peptides derived from neural proteins, which reflects a shared cellular origin that could be exploited for vaccine design. These results suggest that polymorphisms in MHC-I molecules between tumours and host can be ‘hidden’ by a common peptide motif, providing the potential for permissive passage of infectious cells and demonstrating complexity in mammalian histocompatibility barriers.","tags":["contagious cancer","immunopeptidome","marsupial","MHC","Tasmanian devil","Transmissible cancer"],"title":"The immunopeptidomes of two transmissible cancers and their host have a common, dominant peptide motif","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alistair Bailey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"1a9cdd39e3cc5a4993779412553d5f53","permalink":"https://ab604.uk/pubs/old-content/content/publication/alistair-bailey-89645840/","publishdate":"2021-08-25T08:04:42.909595Z","relpermalink":"/pubs/old-content/content/publication/alistair-bailey-89645840/","section":"pubs","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"The immunopeptidomes of two transmissible cancers and their host have a common, dominant peptide motif.","type":"pubs"},{"authors":["Alistair Bailey","Ben Nicholas","Rachel Darley","Erika Parkinson","Ying Teo","Maja Aleksic","Gavin Maxwell","Tim Elliott","Michael Ardern-Jones","Paul Skipp"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button to import publication metadata into your reference management software.

There exists three nonmutually exclusive hypotheses for how haptens mediate CTL recognition: direct stimulation by haptenated peptides; hapten modification of HLA leading to an altered HLA-peptide repertoire; or a hapten altered proteome leading to an an altered HLA-peptide repertoire. To shed light on the mechanism underpinning skin sensitization, we set out to utilize proteomic analysis of keratinocyte presented antigens following exposure to 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene (DNCB). We show that following DNCB exposure, cultured keratinocytes present cysteine haptenated (dinitrophenylated) peptides in multiple HLA molecules. In addition, we find that one of the DNCB modified peptides derives from the active site of cytosolic glutathione-S transferase-ω. These results support the current view that a key mechanism of skin sensitization is stimulation of CTLs by haptenated peptides.

Crystallographic structures of TCR-peptide/MHC complexes have demonstrated how TCRs simultaneously interact with both the peptide and the MHC protein. However, it is increasingly recognized that, beyond serving as a static platform for peptide presentation, the physical properties of class I MHC proteins are tuned by different peptides in ways that are not always structurally visible. These include MHC protein motions, or dynamics, which are believed to influence interactions with a variety of MHC-binding proteins, including not only TCRs, but other activating and inhibitory receptors as well as components of the peptide loading machinery. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which peptides tune the dynamics of the common class I MHC protein HLA-A2. By examining more than 50 lengthy molecular dynamics simulations of HLA-A2 presenting different peptides, we identified regions susceptible to dynamic tuning, including regions in the peptide binding domain as well as the distal a3 domain. Further analyses of the simulations illuminated mechanisms by which the influences of different peptides are communicated throughout the protein, and involve regions of the peptide binding groove, the B2-microglobulin subunit, and the a3 domain. Overall, our results demonstrate that the class I MHC protein is a highly tunable peptide sensor whose physical properties vary considerably with bound peptide.

Our data provides insight into the underlying principles and suggest a role for dynamically driven allostery in the immunological function of MHC proteins.","tags":null,"title":"Dynamically Driven Allostery in MHC Proteins: Peptide-Dependent Tuning of Class I MHC Global Flexibility","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alistair Bailey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"986fd5a0f7390ea5f9b5546ed90f0ff3","permalink":"https://ab604.uk/pubs/old-content/content/publication/alistair-bailey-73909069/","publishdate":"2021-08-25T08:04:42.944674Z","relpermalink":"/pubs/old-content/content/publication/alistair-bailey-73909069/","section":"pubs","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Dynamically Driven Allostery in MHC Proteins: Peptide-Dependent Tuning of Class I MHC Global Flexibility","type":"pubs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1541894400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541894400,"objectID":"8f43461731dd97c4a651077967359c83","permalink":"https://ab604.uk/project/2018-11-11-colour-palette-tutorial/","publishdate":"2018-11-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/2018-11-11-colour-palette-tutorial/","section":"project","summary":"A tutorial is to demonstrate one way to create a colour palette and corresponding gradients in R","tags":["R"],"title":"Creating and using a colour palette and colour gradients for plotting","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1539388800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539388800,"objectID":"8c506ddb21e4abc508721455a75fe8e2","permalink":"https://ab604.uk/project/2018-10-13-umea-swc-workshop/","publishdate":"2018-10-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/2018-10-13-umea-swc-workshop/","section":"project","summary":"Slides from  Software Carpentry Workshop, 9th and 10th October 2018 in Umeå Sweden","tags":null,"title":"Umeå Software Carpentry Workshop","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1531699200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1531699200,"objectID":"0f3865a1c8f9ce3a251915e2ba95f4b1","permalink":"https://ab604.uk/project/2018-07-16-bspr-workshop/","publishdate":"2018-07-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/2018-07-16-bspr-workshop/","section":"project","summary":"Materials for proteomics data science workshop including introduction to R, Volcano plots, heatmaps and peptide logos","tags":["R","Proteomics"],"title":"British Society for Proteomics 2018 Data Science Workshop","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1524182400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524182400,"objectID":"83d22dd1de2688cc21daae97b357c3a1","permalink":"https://ab604.uk/project/2018-06-17-mhc-ml/","publishdate":"2018-04-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/2018-06-17-mhc-ml/","section":"project","summary":"A toy model that attempts to classify peptides from my some of my experiments according to one of five MHC class I allotypes present in the cells I use.","tags":["R","Deep Learning","MHC I antigen processing"],"title":"Machine Learning for MHC I peptide classification","type":"project"},{"authors":["Andy van Hateren","Malcolm Anderson","Alistair Bailey","Jörn M.

We used in vivo biochemical data to infer that a conformational intermediate of MHC I is significant for peptide selection. We used molecular dynamics simulations to show that peptide selector function correlates with protein plasticity, and confirmed this experimentally by altering the plasticity of MHC I with a single point mutation, which altered in vivo selector function in a predictable way. Finally, we investigated the mechanisms by which the co-factor tapasin influences MHC I plasticity. We propose that tapasin modulates MHC I plasticity by dynamically coupling the peptide binding region and α3 domain of MHC I allosterically, resulting in enhanced peptide selector function.\n","tags":null,"title":"Selector function of MHC I molecules is determined by protein plasticity","type":"pubs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1432080000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1432080000,"objectID":"55bb89b8d5ff8d511c5af9ec9266f8e6","permalink":"https://ab604.uk/project/2018-05-17-biochem-calculator/","publishdate":"2015-05-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/2018-05-17-biochem-calculator/","section":"project","summary":"A Shiny app I made for calculating the amount to weigh out or dilute for making solutions","tags":["R"],"title":"Biochem Calculator","type":"project"},{"authors":["Alistair Bailey","Andy van Hateren","Tim Elliott","Jörn M.
